## Sprint 1

### Contributions

- Aly Badr
  - Worked on creating the shapes.
  - Worked on creating the panels and menu for the game window.
- Lucas Jeong
  - Created the methods to allow painting within panels.
  - Created some tetrominos in the game panels.
- Dmitry Khotinskiy
  - Set up initial panels in the main `Tetris` class.
  - Separated panels into separate classes.
  - Cleaned up the warnings before commiting.
- Bradon Phan
  - Double checked the requirements and trying to fix or note any errors.
  - Creating tetrominoes in the game panel.

### Comments

- Used `protected` level of encapsulation to "supress" the warning of
  `'public' method 'paintComponent()' is not exposed via an interface`.

- Hard coded the x- and y-coordinates for the tetromino locations so there are
  warnings `Magic number '_'` and `Actual value of parameter '___' is always '_'`.
